# hello_me

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## DRY PART ANSWERS
    1. The used class is SnappingSheetController(). It allows the developper to control the size 
    of the Snapping Sheet when the user scrolls.

    2. To change the snap positions for the sheet, we can change the snappingPositions parameter 
    which takes in a list of SnappingPosition.factor or SnappingPosition.pixels. These two objects 
    are used to specify the location using a factor or pixels. 

    3. InkWell react to touches with ink splash effect. GestureDetector can be without an child and 
    fit to it parent
